# Cheaper Meal Plan

## Project Overview
This project is a work-in-progress for building a simple meal planning application. The main idea is to help users find recipes and identify the cheapest places to buy ingredients.

## To-Do List

### Website Functionality
- [ ] **Static Website Compatibility**  
      Ensure the website works as a static site, similar to the current setup on Digital Ocean.

- [ ] **Database Management**  
      Use Firebase or a similar service to manage the database. Test Azure's SQL database as an alternative.

- [ ] **Preloaded Recipes**  
      Add at least one recipe before implementing the core functionality.

- [ ] **CRUD for Recipes**  
      - Enable Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for recipes.  
      - Initially, only the admin (myself) will have permissions for Update and Delete.

- [ ] **Recipe Source**  
      Decide whether recipes should:
      - Be added by users.  
      - Be sourced from another website to prevent modification of certain recipes.

- [ ] **Ingredient Price Checker**  
      Implement functionality to send selected recipes to another page that:  
      - Gathers all ingredients.  
      - Checks where they can be purchased at the lowest prices.

### Design
- [ ] **One-Page Layout**  
      - A generic and minimalistic design resembling a webshop.  
      - One side displays an image, and the other contains all necessary information and options.

## Future Plans
- [ ] **Recipe Sharing**  
      Expand functionality to allow users to:  
      - Upload their own recipes.  
      - Share "discount meals" with other users.
