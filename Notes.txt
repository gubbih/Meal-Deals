Find a fix:
ABC store has multiply catelogs for every loaction they have, so alot of offers from ABC is the same
fixes?
Merge all ABC stores together, might bring out wrong data from some ABC sotre and catelog link is going to be wrong
let it be and let there be multipel ABC offers of the same thing
delete ABC from the offer call, ABC is mostly a niche store in denmark, but some people might be unhappy
