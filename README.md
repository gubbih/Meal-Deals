## Overview
This project aims to create a simple and cost-effective meal planning application. The goal is to help users find recipes and purchase ingredients at the lowest prices.

## Features

### Website Functionality
- **Static Website Compatibility**  
  The website should work as a static site, similar to the current setup on Digital Ocean.

- **Database Management**  
  Use Firebase or a similar service to manage the database. Azure's SQL database may also be tested as an alternative.

- **Preloaded Recipes**  
  Ensure there is at least one recipe available before implementing the core functionality.

- **CRUD for Recipes**  
  - Users/Admins can create, update, and delete recipes.  
  - Initially, only the admin (myself) will have these permissions.

- **Recipe Source**  
  Decide if recipes should be user-submitted or sourced from another website to prevent modification of certain recipes.

- **Ingredient Price Checker**  
  Once a recipe is selected, send it to another page where all ingredients are gathered and checked for the lowest prices across various stores.

## Design

- **One-Page Layout**  
  - Generic and minimalistic, resembling a webshop.
  - One side displays an image, and the other side contains all necessary information and options.

## Future Plans

- **Recipe Sharing**  
  Expand the platform to allow users to share their own recipes and view "discount meals" created by others.
